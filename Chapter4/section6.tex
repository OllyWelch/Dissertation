\section{The Numbers $N(T)$ and $N(T, \chi)$}
We now turn our attention to formulas of the type conjectured by Riemann and proved by von Mangoldt. These concern the number of zeros of L-functions below a given height in the critical strip - essentially estimating how frequently the non-trivial zeros occur.
